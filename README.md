# ðŸ¦€ Rust Playground
Welcome to my Rust learning repository! I made this repository to get started with learning Rust through simple projects.

## Getting Started
To run a Rust app from this repository, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running a Rust App using Cargo
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsthistim/rust-playground.git
``` 

2. **Choose a Project:** Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run. Each project is contained within its own directory.
```bash
cd rust-playground/hello-world
```

3. **Run the App:** Once you're in the project directory, you can use Cargo to run the app.
```bash
cargo run
```
